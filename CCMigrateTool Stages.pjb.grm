/*
* This rule detects the use of DEPRECATED stages in Parallel Jobs
* and suggests the recommended alternative
*
* Rationale:
* From time to time, older Stage Types are updated/replaced. 
* While the older Stage Types will continue to function, it is recommended to use the newer replacement Stage Types
*
* HOW TO USE
* If the client is running 11.7 or higher, don't comment out any rules
* If the client is running 9.1, comment out all the 11.7 rules
* If the client is running 8.7, comment out all the 9.1 and 11.7 rules
* If the client is running 8.5, comment out all the 8.7 and 9.1 rules
* If the client is running below 8.5, comment out all the rules [but tell them to get an upgrade ;)]
*
